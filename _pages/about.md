I currently teach [Python for Data Visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-visualization/effectively-present-data-with-python) for LinkedIn Learning and [Data Analytics using Python](https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-analytics-using-python) for UCSD Extension. I have previously taught Essential Python for Global Knowledge and Data Science (Python) at General Assembly.
