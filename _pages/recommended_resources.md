This is not a complete list as I am still building it. I should note that I prefer books to courses so I am more knowledgeable about them. 

# Recommended Books
## <b>[Build a Career in Data Science (Emily Robinson & Jacqueline Nolis)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science)</b><br>
<img src='/images/buildcareerdatascience.png' width="258" height="325">

Benefits: 
* Good career advice for different types of jobs and companies
* Underrated interview questions in the book
* Good advice on different data science projects
* Good knowledge of how to build a portfolio
* Mentions my blog post, ["How to Build a Data Science Portfolio"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Havent finished the book yet since it just came out March 24, 2020

## <b>[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD (Jeremy Howard & Sylvain Gugger)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)</b><br>
<img src='/images/deeplearningforcoders.jpg' width="254" height="332">

I am waiting for this book to be released on August 4, 2020. Book uses fastai  (Pytorch and Other Library Wrappers). 

## <b>[Deep Learning with Python (François Chollet)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438)</b><br>
<img src='/images/deeplearningwithpythonFrancoisChollet.jpg' width="266" height="333">

Benefits:
* Written by François Chollet, creator of Keras
* Massively popular book
* First edition already out, second edition will be out in the fall 2020 (I have an early version of the edition and I like it)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* In late 2018, Keras and TensorFlow became more attached to each other. The first edition was published before that. 

## <b>[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (Andreas C. Muller & Sarah Guido)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413)</b><br>
<img src='/images/introductionToMachineLearningWithPython.jpg' width="190" height="249">

Benefits: 
* Very good machine learning introduction for visual learners (The author put a lot of time into making images for the book, this is not a common thing)
* Book gives intuitive explanation of how algorithms work 
* Authors are big in the machine learning community

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* First edition published in 2016 so I would like a second edition, but the book is still relevant
* Not a lot of math (in case you want to dive deep into it)

## <b>[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher M. Bishop)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738)</b><br>
<img src='/images/patternrecognitionmachinelearning.jpg' width="246" height="333">

Benefits: 
* Very good machine learning theory with relatively intuitive math

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Book published in 2006 so probably needs some updating
* You need to know linear algebra and calculus to understand a lot of the book

## <b>[Python Data Science Handbook (Jake VanderPlas)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do)</b><br>
<img src='/images/pythondatasciencehandbook.png' width="252" height="333">

Benefits: 
* Book covers jupyter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and some scikit-learn
* Read the book in its entirety online at [https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
* Book is constantly updated online

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* The machine learning part is too basic

## <b>[Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili)](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1789955750/)</b><br>
<img src='/images/pythonMachineLearning.jpg' width="202" height="257">

Benefits: 
* TensorFlow/Keras/Scikit-Learn based
* Machine Learning to Deep Learning explanations are pretty good
* Nice images supporting concepts
* Published in late 2019 with the author constantly updating the book's code

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* I dont like the initial explanation of deep learning relative to other sources in this list

## <b>[The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie & Tibshirani & Friedman)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576)</b><br>
<img src='/images/elementsStatisticalLearning.jpg' width="222" height="333">

Benefits: 
* Great statistical theory for a lot of basic machine learning algorithms
* I like the section on wide data (p bigger than n).

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Uses R for examples 

# Recommended Courses
## <b>[Coursera: Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)</b><br>
<img src='/images/michigan.png' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* Good for some machine learning/data science introduction in python

Drawbacks: 
* Never took all of the courses myself
* Less basic than python for everybody, but still basic

## <b>[Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)</b><br>
<img src='/images/deepLearningSpecialization.png' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* TensorFlow based
* Great theory
* Everyone knows the content for the course so interview quesions commonly come from it
* Most quizzes are good tests of knowledge

Drawbacks: 
* Haven't finished this yet so not familiar enough to criticize. 

## <b>[Coursera: Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)</b><br>
<img src='/images/michigan.png' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* Great starter course for people learning python in a data science context
* A lot of courses derive their material from this specialization (5 courses) on Python
* You can audit without paying (hard to figure out for some)

Drawbacks: 
* Course is basic

## <b>[Coursera: Machine Learning (Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)</b><br>
<img src='/images/stanfordMachineLearning.jpeg' width="305" height="165">

Benefits: 
* Great theory
* Everyone knows the content for the course so interview quesions commonly come from it
* Most quizzes are good tests of knowledge
* You can audit without paying (hard to figure out for some)

Drawbacks: 
* I would highly recommend NOT doing the assignments since they are in Octave/MATLAB which almost nobody uses in industry
* It is an older class which hasn't been updated, but this is a minor issue

## <b>[fastai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)</b><br>
<img src='/images/fastai.png' width="325" height="155">

Benefits: 
* fastai based (Pytorch and Other Library Wrappers)
* Learn by doing, probably the fastest way to start doing deep learning
* Free 

Drawbacks: 
* Haven't finished this yet so not familiar enough to criticize

## <b>[LinkedIn Learning: Python for Data Visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-visualization/effectively-present-data-with-python) </b><br>
<img src='/images/pythonDataVisualization.jpeg' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* I made this course on pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc
* Nicely edited in October 2019

Drawbacks: 
* Course is about 2 hours
