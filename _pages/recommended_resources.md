# Recommended Books
## <b>[Build a Career in Data Science (Emily Robinson & Jacqueline Nolis)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science)</b><br>
<img src='/images/buildcareerdatascience.png' width="240" height="301">

Benefits: 
* Good career advice for different types of jobs and companies
* Underrated interview questions in the book
* Good advice on different data science projects
* Good knowledge of how to build a portfolio
* Mentions my blog post, ["How to Build a Data Science Portfolio"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* Havent finished the book yet since it just came out March 24, 2020

## <b>[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (Andreas C. Muller & Sarah Guido)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413)</b><br>
<img src='/images/introductionToMachineLearningWithPython.jpg' width="190" height="249">

Benefits: 
* Very good machine learning introduction for visual learners (The author put a lot of time into making images for the book, this is not a common thing)
* Book gives intuitive explanation of how algorithms work 
* Authors are big in the machine learning community

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* First edition published in 2016 so I would like a second edition, but the book is still relevant
* Not a lot of math (in case you want to dive deep into it)

## <b>[Python Machine Learning (Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)</b><br>
<img src='/images/pythonMachineLearning.jpg' width="202" height="257">

Benefits: 
* Machine Learning to Deep Learning explanations are pretty good
* Nice images supporting concepts
* Published in late 2019 with the author constantly updating the book's code

Drawbacks (I am reaching on this): 
* I dont like the initial explanation of deep learning relative to other sources in this list

# Recommended Courses
## <b>[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)</b><br>
<img src='/images/michigan.png' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* Good for some machine learning/data science introduction in python

Drawbacks: 
* Never took all of the courses myself.
* Less basic than python for everybody, but still nothing too crazy. 


## <b>[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)</b><br>
<img src='/images/michigan.png' width="310" height="163">

Benefits: 
* Great starter course for people learning python in a data science context
* A lot of courses derive their material from this specialization (5 courses) on Python

Drawbacks: 
* Course is basic

## <b>[Coursera: Machine Learning (Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)</b><br>
<img src='/images/stanfordMachineLearning.jpeg' width="305" height="165">

Benefits: 
* Great theory
* Everyone knows the content for the course so interview quesions commonly come from it
* Most quizzes are good tests of knowledge

Drawbacks: 
* I would highly recommend NOT doing the assignments since they are in Octave/MATLAB which almost nobody uses in industry.
* It is an older class which hasn't been updated, but this is a minor issue.

## [Python for Data Visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-for-data-visualization/effectively-present-data-with-python)
<b>LinkedIn Learning</b><br>
Data visualization is incredibly important for data scientists, as it helps them communicate their insights to nontechnical peers. But you don't need to be a design pro. Python is a popular, easy-to-use programming language that offers a number of libraries specifically built for data visualization. In this course from the experts at Madecraft, you can learn how to build accurate, engaging, and easy-to-generate charts and graphs using Python. Explore the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, and then discover how to load and clean data sets and create simple and advanced plots, including heatmaps, histograms, and subplots. Instructor Michael Galarnyk provides all the instruction you need to create professional data visualizations through programming. You can see a sample video <a href='https://youtu.be/BE8CVGJuftI'> here</a>.

## [Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/machine-learning-fundamentals)
<b>UC San Diego Extension</b><br>
Utilizing machine learning to apply algorithms to their data has helped companies maximize efficiencies, pursue new markets, and create new products. This trend has prompted many industries to recognize the value of machine learning, creating a high demand for knowledge in this field. Understanding the theory of how machine learning algorithms work is not only important skill for being able to apply and debug code, but also an important skill for interviewing.
<br>
In this course, students will learn how machine learning algorithms work so they can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of popular machine learning algorithms and when to apply which algorithm in real world situations. Some of the algorithms we will cover in the course include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, bagged trees, gradient boosting, principal component analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, support vector machines, na√Øve Bayes, and recommender systems. The course will also cover topics such as model validation, regularization, optimization functions, hyperparameter tuning, and methods to deal with unbalanced classes.
<br>
Toward the end of the course, we will touch on use cases where traditional machine learning algorithms are suboptimal and where deep learning can be more appropriate. These deep learning techniques will include image classification and natural language processing.

## Machine Learning with Python
<b>Stanford Continuing Studies</b><br>
Utilizing machine learning to apply algorithms to their data has helped companies maximize efficiencies, pursue new markets, and create new products. This trend has prompted many industries to recognize the value of machine learning, creating a high demand for knowledge in this field.
<br>
This course will cover machine learning foundations and some of the leading open source tools in Python. We will start by learning the various strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning algorithms and then apply them to real-world situations. Additionally, we will touch on use cases where deep learning is appropriate, such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
<br>
We will use the Python data science ecosystem to perform machine learning and deep learning. These tools are open source and popular among data scientists in both academia and industry. The tools we will use include Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, plotting with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and machine learning with Scikit-Learn.
<br>
Some of the algorithms we will cover in the course include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, principal component analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and recommender systems. Students will leave the course with a solid understanding of several machine learning algorithms and the ability to use them when appropriate.
